#### The case for REST
>> *Coming soon as a part of AWS SheBuilds Summit on Nov 19, 2021*

GraphQL, the query language for graph databases, is gaining traction mainly due to its ease of use and how it addresses over-fetching and under-fetching. Every API architectural style has its own pros and cons, applications, and caveats. There is no use steering clear of one for a simple use case when you can incorporate it on your own in the existing style. While REST is preferred for applications involving CRUD, GraphQL is preferred for building composite APIs/microservices. This article will walk you through over-fetching and under-fetching without shifting to an entirely new architectural style like GraphQL. We can use sparse fieldsets or field grouping to handle over-fetching, and we can use compound documents for under-fetching.

#### Dependency management using git
>> *Presented at GitHub Universe on Oct 28, 2021*

This talk will cover how git can aid in dependency management in-house by using submodules, subtrees, and subrepo. This talk will also review the caveats, differences, applications—for example, single-sourcing documentation and publishing the same documentation in various platforms such as wiki and gitbook—and other alternatives, like git repo and gitslave, that can help you achieve dependency management.
